Recitation is a required component of PHYS 245. The primary intent of the recitation is to refine your understanding of physics concepts, to develop your analysis and problem-solving skills.

Each week there are a couple of activities/tutorials which you will work on **individually**. These activities are designed to help you think through new challenging concepts in physics. Your recitation grade is based on completeness and effort in the assignments each week. **NOTE: your recitation grade is only 10% of your lecture grade. All tutorials count, nothing is dropped.**

These activities are provided on **MS Forms** (works best in Chrome). If you are not familiar with MS Forms, you will need to sign in using your “@gmu.edu” email address. Each form will have specific deadlines, you can only submit once and as far as I can tell, you can save and continue later. Ideally each activity should take about 1-2 hours to complete, which is the normal time granted for recitation in a typical semester.

All students are expected to adhere to the highest level of personal integrity and responsibility. This includes meeting course deadlines, communicating in a respectful manner with fellow students as well as instructors, and following Mason’s Honor Code. **NOTE: MS Forms records everyone's responses so plagiarism can be checked for each assignment.**

- "*" --> This tutorial requires you to **upload a drawing to a diagram**; there will be periods where you will have to do that depending on the tutorial. Your drawing can be any file format, and it can be done on either a tablet or paper. You may want to make sure you have a ruler/protractor handy.
- ** --> Password in Discord under #recordings
- **NOTE:** the first week's tutorials were created in different styles, as we weren't sure which format worked best for you. We value feedback, so please after you have completed the first two tutorials, **please complete the following survey [here](https://forms.office.com/r/ieZCB5qeZ0) so we may format the remaining tutorials to your liking**.
- The remaining tutorials reflect the results of this survey.
- *** There are no recordings this week because no one showed up with questions.

Please see me and contact the Office of Disability Services at 703-993-2474. All academic accommodations must be arranged through that office. Students must inform the instructor at the beginning on the semester, and the specific accommodation will be arranged through ODS.
