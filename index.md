Recitation is a required component of PHYS 245. The primary intent of the recitation is to refine your understanding of physics concepts, to develop your analysis and problem-solving skills.

Each week there are a couple of activities/tutorials which you will work on **individually**. These activities are designed to help you think through new challenging concepts in physics. Your recitation grade is based on completeness and effort in the assignments each week. **Remember: your recitation grade is only 10% of your lecture grade.**

These activities are provided on **MS Forms** (works best in Chrome). If you are not familiar with MS Forms, you will need to sign in using your “@gmu.edu” email address. Each form will have specific deadlines, you can only submit once and as far as I can tell, you cannot save and continue later. So I would recommend giving yourself 1-2 hours set time each week to complete these activities, which is the normal time granted for recitation in a typical semester.

All students are expected to adhere to the highest level of personal integrity and responsibility. This includes meeting course deadlines, communicating in a respectful manner with fellow students as well as instructors, and following Mason’s Honor Code. **NOTE: MS Forms records everyone's responses so plagiarism can be checked for each assignment.**

**NOTE: the first week's tutorials were created in different styles, as we weren't sure which format worked best for you. We value feedback, so please after you have completed the first two tutorials, please complete the following survey [here](https://forms.office.com/r/ieZCB5qeZ0) so we may format the remaining tutorials to your liking.**

## Student Privacy 

Most Mason students are legally adults and their legal rights must be fully respected. A professor cannot discuss the student’s information without the written permission of that student.

For more information on Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), please go to [https://registrar.gmu.edu/ferpa/](https://registrar.gmu.edu/ferpa/).

## If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations:
Please see me and contact the Office of Disability Services at 703-993-2474. All academic accommodations must be arranged through that office. Students must inform the instructor at the beginning on the semester, and the specific accommodation will be arranged through ODS.

GMU is committed to providing each student an equal opportunity to pursue a college education regardless of disability. Students requiring special needs in accordance with the Americans With Disabilities Act must provide to the professor their Accommodation Form. Every effort will be made to meet student’s special needs when the student makes those needs known appropriately. It is the student’s responsibility, not a counselor’s, to present the Accommodation Form to the professor. Accommodations will begin as soon as the form is received and are not retroactive.
